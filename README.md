# Furever Yours

This project, which we named Furever Yours, is part of the Project 3 assignment for U.C. Berkeley Extension's Coding Boot Camp. Our names are Eric Rothmuller, Alejandra Izquierdo, Priya Rizal, Daniel Stefani, and William Wei and we are all students of the Boot Camp. In this project we were tasked with creating an interactive MERN Stack Application that met certain criteria. We decided to make an application that utilizes Adopt-A-Pet's API which allows you to search for adoptable pets within their database.
